* pdmt is influenced by scons but also very different from scons.
* pdmt usage is JUST LIKE regular python. Pdmt is a python library first.
* extending pdmt requires python knowledge and oo knowledge.
* pdmt has a command line interface.
* pdmt can be used for continuous builds as it can watch files for changes.
* pdmt doesn't just work on files. It can work on records from databases too.
It can watch remote urls.
It has dependency on configuration as well.
