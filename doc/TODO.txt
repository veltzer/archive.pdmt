now:
====
- get to a situation where I can install and remove my debian package without putting in a passphrase.
	Do it in ANY WAY YOU SEE FIT.
	preferably create a signing key which does not require a pass phrase.
	maybe there is a way for a GPG AGENT to propagate pass sudo? If so user 'mark'
	could sing for what user 'root' is doing. That would be the best solution.
	make the reprepro script a pdmt plugin.

- the todo list is not very effective.
	it is asked using the "in" operator alot and it is a list - better make it an ordered set.
		(it does have order).
	actually - the todo list should be a tree since it does have dependencies and the tree structure
	could be used for parallelism.
		(find an algorithm for that).
- what happens if I touch an object file. that is very weird. think about it.

- create a site using mako for templating.
	(make install to install the site).
- bring a python documentation tool and create documentation out of the source code.
	install that documentation onto the site.
