now:
====
- make the packaging a pdmt plugin (stop using the makefile and eliminate it
	if possible).
- make the reprepro script a pdmt plugin.

- the todo list is not very effective.
	it is asked using the "in" operator alot and it is a list - better make it an ordered set.
		(it does have order).
	actually - the todo list should be a tree since it does have dependencies and the tree structure
	could be used for parallelism.
		(find an algorithm for that).
- what happens if I touch an object file. that is very weird. think about it.
- create a site using mako for templating.
	(make install to install the site).
- bring a python documentation tool and create documentation out of the source code.
	install that documentation onto the site.
