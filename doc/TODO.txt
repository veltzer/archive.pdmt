Now:
====
- create the deb package as part of pdmt (with dependencies)
- define installation of the package as depending on the deb package.

- get ridd of setup.py (it should a part of the module that knows how to create
	the deb package).
- add the code from myrepo to create a repository.
- add hooks to pdmt to enable commands with no relation to the graph.
	hook the commands in reprepro to them.
- get ridd of the makefile by adding:
	pdmt clean hooks.
		- one hook to remove all files of a certain extension.
		- one hook to remove a set of folders recursivly.
- add mako suppport in pdmt and create a website for it.

- make the reprepro script a pdmt plugin.

- the todo list is not very effective.
	it is asked using the "in" operator alot and it is a list - better make it an ordered set.
		(it does have order).
	actually - the todo list should be a tree since it does have dependencies and the tree structure
	could be used for parallelism.
		(find an algorithm for that).
- what happens if I touch an object file. that is very weird. think about it.
- create a site using mako for templating.
	(make install to install the site).
- bring a python documentation tool and create documentation out of the source code.
	install that documentation onto the site.
