pdmt should be able to work with checksums in stead of file modification times.

This document deals with how this should be implemented.

pdmt should store a database with digital signatures
	each target should store a sig into that database with the signature that
		created it.
		that signature should be the concatenation of all signatures
		of all sources for that target and the process that created
		the target (flags for instance).
	when a target is built:
		- if the target is not there (as file) it should be rebuilt
		- if the target is there, check the signature of its sources
			- if the signature is not the same, rebuilt the target
			- if the signature is the same then check that the
			target signature is the same.
				- if it is the same - don't do anything.
				- if it is not the same - rebuild the target.
