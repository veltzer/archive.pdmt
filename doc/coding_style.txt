- because there are many reserved names in python and the parser is not that
	hot then method arguments will be p_[name] (p_type,p_print,...)
- name spaces:
	the name space for pdmt is pdmt.
	it does not cause problems since a script called pdmt.py should
	NOT be distributed with the pdmt package (deb, rpm, ...).
