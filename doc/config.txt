This is a document describing various types of configs in pdmt

softconfig
==========
these are variables stored in RAM by pdmt at run time. You can change them.
They influence how pdmt runs (verbose/nonverbose, logging more).
THEY DO NOT EFFECT THE FINAL OUTPUTS OF PDMT.

what happens when you change them?
nothing

do they have dependencies between them?
no

config nodes
============
are nodes within the graph that have dates.
They are persistent and stored between each run.
You can also init their value from some source file if you like.
THEY EFFECT THE OUTPUTS OF PDMT.

what happens when you change them?
possibly you will need to rebuild some of your nodes (but there is no need
to do anything special as the next build will calculate everything properly).

do they have dependencies between them?
possibly.

graph config
============
This is a new idea: these are configs which influence the structure of the graph like
in "menu config" in the kernel. when you change them the strcture of the graph changes.

what happens when you change them?
I need to think about this.
One obvious answer is recreate the whole graph.
One more 

do they have dependencies between them?
yes. Just like in the linux kernel if one variable is turned on it means something about other variables.
They are not just "dependant". there are rules to describe which config is possible and which is not.
the UI and core should be designed in such a way as not to allow to make configs which are contrary to
these rules.
