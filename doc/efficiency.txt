efficiency in message passing
=============================
- assumption: most event handlers handle one type of event.
	Is that right ?!?
	Could I not write one event handler that will handle all events
	having to do with C compilation?
		- Scanning of source code+
		- c -> o node
		- adding nodes in a directory.
	generation, o->exe generation, compilation and linking ?
- under the assumption that most event handlers do not want to register
	to all types of events how can we handle this more efficiently?
	- allow event handlers only to register to certain types of events.
	- allow event handlers only to register to certain parts of the tree
		(only events in a "folder" or "subproject").
	- this way number of event handlers called will remain small.
	- this requires the construction of an event passing library.
		(not too complicated).
