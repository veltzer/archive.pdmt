In order to build pdmt we will need a python graph object.

I had issues with pygraph and so I built my own graph object.
We should recosider this descision since python3 now carries
pygraph.

the graph and locking.
Currenly we have no locking issues with the graph since we are using
it only from one thread. It is possible that entire core of PDMT
will continue to run in just one thread. It seems enough.

Callbacks to the single thread of PDMT:
- inotify - to notify of files changing.
- tools - to notify of failure or success of building.
- gui - ?!?
