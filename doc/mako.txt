This file documents the integration between pdmt and the mako templating system
===============================================================================
Pdmt can use the mako templating system to create files out of pdmt configuration
variables.

Pdmt also has automatic dependency analysis to determine what each mako template
needs as far as configuration goes.

How is this automatic dependcy analysis mechanism implemented?
Pdmt injects a variable with __get__ detection and so understands exactly what
	each template needs.
