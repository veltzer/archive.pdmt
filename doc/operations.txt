Operations in PDMT
==================
Operations are nodes that depend on certain pdmt nodes.

How do you write an operation?
==============================
1) you write the code for it (python class of node type).
2) you attach it to pdmt telling pdmt on which nodes it depends on.
- you can now run your operation from the command line.
When you run an operation pdmt will first make sure that the nodes in question are
up to date and then will run the operation.

So what is the difference between an operation and a node?
==========================================================
- pdmt does not remmember nor check the time stamp associated with the operation.
- this means that you are alone responsible for running the operation.
