pdmt is heavily based on the concept of a plugin.
A plugin is just a .py file which uses the pdmt API and defines
any type of object that pdmt can use (nodehandlers, builder and more).

The idea is to have an API for pdmt to load plugins.
PDMT will scan a folder for plugins and if it finds files which have
objects of the right type it will just load and register those plugins.

The user should NOT organize plugins into folders according to their
type etc. The user could also write a one python file with two or
three plugins. This should be supported.
