The issue of pdmt and RAM is very important because we may hold
very large graphs in RAM.

ideas:
- We already implemented the 'getsizeof' method for the graph (you
can use it via the tui).
- Maybe we could just look at the operating system reports for the python
process?
- We may want to take a look at python3-memprof module.
- other modules (see ubuntu_install.py)
- see references below
- use the flyweight pattern for the nodes? It seems ideal.
