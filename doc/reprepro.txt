These are notes regarding the rerepro plugin to pdmt:
- if you want to not need to put a pass phrase each time this
runs you can use a key without a passphrase in your repository. there may be other options
but I haven't explored them. see gpg documentation about creating a key without a pass phrase.

TODO:
support keys with passphrases well. How would I do that?
	1) don't use sudo - have the repository owned by the user running the script.
	2) propagate the gpg-agent cross sudo(1). Is that possible?
	3) cache the passphrase using '/usr/lib/gnupg2/gpg-preset-passphrase'
	4) feed the passphrase some other way.
