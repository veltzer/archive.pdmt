Scanners are a way to add scan for dependencies.

Classic example: h files in C files.

How should scanners work?

Without scanners:


		[object file node]----------------->[C file node]

With scanner:

		[object file node]----------------->[C file node]
					|	+-->
					|	|
					+--->[scanner node]--------->[h files]*


The problem is how to set this all up and handle it.

And another complication is that we need a different setup like this per object file node variant (debug, release, etc).

So we will need some porcelain code to set this part of the graph up whenever we add a C file in.
